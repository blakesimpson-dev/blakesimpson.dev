A unique art style combines beautiful hand-painted 2D backgrounds and lively 3D characters. Guide Hope Andrews home across an undead-infested UK back to London. Along the way team up with an unlikely partner - a sentient zombie called Dave Gorey who formerly worked PR for the government's undead-raising program. Can they make it past the ELU horde together?

    "content": "Aliensche! was HiVE interactive’s entry into Ludum Dare LDJAM #33. The original version was made in ~34 hours. Collect cows and avoid projectiles as an invading alien in an unidentified craft! As an extra terrestrial, you are obviously fascinated by Earth’s bovine inhabitants. Your mission is to collect super cute cow specimens for your research requirements by delivering them to them to the mother ship. However, the Cow Defense Forces have been mobilized! You will need to catch cows while avoiding their attacks so you will have to keep mooooooving. Remember, if you are in trouble you can utilize your advanced cow collecting technology as a weapon against the defenders – pick them up and throw them down hard, or grab their missiles and send them back!",
